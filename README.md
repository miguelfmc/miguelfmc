### Hi there, I'm Miguel üëã

I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building machine learning solutions to solve all sorts of problems. I'm particularly interested in the connection between machine learning, decision science and optimization. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Scientist at PayPal.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on:
  - Sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills
  - Learning about some of the crazier and less known Python "ins and outs" like metaclasses, descriptors and coroutines
  - Trying to keep up with the latest in AI, especially LLMs!
  - Getting a better grasp on the fairly extensive Recommender Systems literature
  - Revamping my personal portfolio
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning the basics of MLOps, Recommender Systems, Bayesian Statistics and uncertainty quantification for ML (especially conformal prediction!)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: in a past life, I played the drums in a band ü•Å
