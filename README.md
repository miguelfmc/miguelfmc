### Hi there, I'm Miguel 👋

I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building machine learning solutions to solve all sorts of problems. I'm particularly interested in the connection between machine learning, decision science and optimization. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Scientist at PayPal.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - A scikit-learn compatible package for subset selection
  - Sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills
  - Revamping my personal portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of MLOps, Bayesian Statistics and uncertainty quantification for ML (especially conformal prediction!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: in a past life, I played the drums in a band 🥁

<!-- I also write about non-data related topics in my blog -->
