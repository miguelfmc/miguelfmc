### Hi there, I'm Miguel üëã

I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building machine learning solutions to solve all sorts of problems. I'm particularly interested in the connection between machine learning, decision science and optimization. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Scientist at PayPal.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on:
  - Sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills
  - Revamping my personal portfolio
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning the basics of MLOps, Bayesian Statistics and uncertainty quantification for ML (especially conformal prediction!)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: in a past life, I played the drums in a band ü•Å

<!-- I also write about non-data related topics in my blog -->
